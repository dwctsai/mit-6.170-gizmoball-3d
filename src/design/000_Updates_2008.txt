Seems that in Java 3D API 1.5, they deprecated a couple of things.
Namely, I commented out:

gui.picking.behaviors >>

--PickMouseBehavior.java: All the lines in updateScene()

--PickRotate/Translate/ZoomBehavior.java: Commented out "freePickResult(pr);" in updateScene()

Only commented them out to clear the compile errors, but did not bug-test for possible effects.
