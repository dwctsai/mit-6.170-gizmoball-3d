# Gizmoball 3D

## Overview

- Gizmoball 3D is a pinball game made with Java 3D.  The objective is to keep a ball moving around a three-dimensional playing space without falling off the bottom of the map.

- The program includes a game editor, where users can create their own custom game boards, as well as designate specific triggers between game pieces.

- Users may also pause the game at anytime and switch perspectives to view the action of the game from different angles. 

- All games are able to be saved and loaded to local disk.

- The game was built using a proprietary physics engine custom-made for this game.
